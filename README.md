# Ethereum Fast

Ethereum Fast is a fork of the Ethereum project with the ambitious goal to introduce a lighter and faster token than Ethereum. Ethrereum Fast acts as an active deterrent for common programming mistakes (with a lighter code), heavy smart contracts, high transaction fees, and slow transaction processes.

Features: Ethereum Fast fixed major issues regarding micro-transactions, allowing you to make deposits to exchanges in time for price or arbitrage opportunities. Because of its decentralized nature, Ethereum Fast is a highly secure and resilient payment system without the requierement of a government or military protection. Ethereum Fast has low transactions fees, allowing you to exchange or trade them without heavy charges between each platform.

Ethereum Fast aims to be a token that allows for true growth of Ethereum as a currency, that's why the dev has focused energy solely on building a token with low transaction fees and high speed transfers. While Ethereum has been valuable and served us well as a starting point, it has known flaws in the way it interacts with smart contracts. These programming cons have been solved by refactoring the Ethereum smart contract code.
